# First Code
---

`run both files as you run a simple python code`

### In this folder i have tried to do the following things:
- main.py
    - In this i am trying to make a fastapi logger, in which i stores all the logs that should be printed in console and now storing in a log file.
    - I have use inbuilt python logger and uvicorn logger libraries.
    - I think main problem with the above code is that when using the script logs are stored in a log file and not concurrency showing in the console.
    - All the script is written in layman order, wants to do it in a class format
- custom_logger.py
    - I have made this code so that i can integrate the code to some python script in future
