# Simple Logging
----

## In this folder i am doing the following things:
- Showing the logs in console and saving the logs in a file
- Here the logging is defined in such a way that a user can add the above code in his/her fastapi backend

---
# Logging using Classes
---

- It is same as Simple Logging
- But in this i have tried to make the structure of my code in a oops manner so that the user can add the logs according to his/her preferences
